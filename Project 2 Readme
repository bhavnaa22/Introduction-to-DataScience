## Project Overview
This project focuses on:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Ensuring data quality through handling missing values, outliers, and data transformations.
2. **EDA:** Visualizing data patterns, correlations, and distributions.
3. **Model Building:** Training and evaluating machine learning models for prediction or classification tasks.
4. **Result Analysis:** Assessing model performance using metrics and visualizations.

### Key Tools and Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
