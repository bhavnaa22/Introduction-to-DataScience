## Project Overview
This project explores [specific dataset/topic] with the following goals:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removing inconsistencies and preparing data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data distribution, correlations, and insights.
3. **Model Building:** Implementing and evaluating machine learning models.

Key tools and libraries:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, etc.)
- Statistical visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, etc.)
- Machine learning model implementations
  - [e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees]
- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)

---
